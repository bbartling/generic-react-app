# rest api script

The Python script is designed to interact securely with a web application that uses HTTPS and self-signed certificates. It operates by first sending a login request to the server using predefined credentials, which, upon successful authentication, returns a JWT token. This token is then utilized in a subsequent request to access protected routes, specifically the dashboard route, which contains financial data. The script includes exception handling to manage potential errors during the login and data retrieval processes. It also bypasses SSL certificate verification (`verify=False`) to accommodate the server's use of self-signed certificates. This approach ensures that the script can securely and effectively retrieve the necessary data while handling common network security configurations.
